# I am Brooke Taylor
My interest in coding started from primary school. I had a lot of fun with simple code sites, such as scratch. This early interest blossomed into a love for coding as a whole, which led me to enjoy more complex languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS during secondary school. In college, I expanded my skill set to include C# and then JavaScript and React for my NEA. Then, at university, I started C++.I have always been into the idea of creating my own games through code. This is because I like the process, and I find it fun.
