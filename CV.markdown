Brooke Taylor

PERSONAL PROFILE

As a current undergraduate student in computer science, I have created games in my spare time for enjoyment. This hobby not only allowed me to practice school-taught coding techniques, but to also learn and expand my knowledge beyond education. My career goal is to continue improving my skills and take on a role as a software developer or game’s developer

EDUCATION

University Of Plymouth [2023 – 2027]

BSc in Computer Science Games Development

Excelled in the computing practice module by developing complex algorithms, exceeding expectations, and achieving high marks in a challenging project. Loved applying theoretical development to a practical environment and was particularly interested in creating something I hadn’t done before. This experience went beyond what I thought I was capable of with my current skills

Exeter College [2021 – 2023]

A level in Mathematics
A level in Computer Science
A level in Graphical Communications

The Park Community School [2016 – 2021]

8 GCSEs including: 
Mathematics
Computer Science
Imedia

Gained a deep interest in computer science during early school years, especially when I was first introduced to python. This exposure solidified my love for creating games and solving problems through programming

SKILLS AND INTERESTS / AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS 

Technical Skills: 

•	Programming languages: C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, React

•	Game Development tools: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code

•	Gameplay Programming: Experience coding 2D games, including a platformer with collision detection, random object generation, and player mechanics

•	Web development: Built a currency converter React app to calculate the sum of money between different currencies. This project helped to understand responsive web design and handling data – skills I wish to apply and improve in games

Teamwork:

•	Collaborated in a pair for coding coursework which helped develop skills in communicating with someone to assign tasks based on strengths and weaknesses

•	Collaborated in a group to create a game for a client. Held group meetings to discuss which clients to go for and any ideas for the project. I also assigned tasks to align with strengths and weaknesses of the team

•	Joined the cheerleading society and worked in a team where teamwork and trust are important, showing ability to rely on other in high-pressured situations

Gaming: 

•	Gaming: Enjoy playing video games and keeping up with in-development games to see what new features other programmers are introducing. Gaming is a way to keep up with emerging trends in the industry which inspires me to add things to my personal development projects

•	Game Development: Enthusiastic about exploring different types of games to code various gameplay experiences, to refine programming skills and explore new features. Enjoy doing different styles and genres for my games for innovation

•	Learning: Eager to improve current skills and learn new programming languages to explore game development techniques. I see unexplored languages and game engines as opportunities to expand my knowledge 

•	Story writing and storytelling: Love to write stories for future personal projects and combining gameplay with narratives to produce more interactive experiences. Believes a fun and engaging story can vastly enhance gameplay

Communication:

•	PowerPoint presentations: Made slides in PowerPoint to present my game project as part of my coursework. This included explaining the ERD and case diagrams I created

•	Meetings: Attended meetings for group project coursework and for the EDI committee

Problem solving:

•	Code: Able to find and fix issues with code to make projects work more efficiently

•	Work sheets: Completed multiple worksheets in college and university – mainly on maths and computer science subjects

PROJECTS

Education Projects

•	Coded a real-time currency converter React app for college NEA. This included features such as page navigation and web page design. Loved the challenge of integrating APIs into code for the first time

•	Programmed a single-page platformer game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This incorporated 2D navigation, collision, randomising objects, and difficulty level selection

Personal Projects

•	Currently coding a cat tycoon game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, where players unlock cats to rebuild a village after an evil wizard destroyed it. This included an animated cutscene, music, sound effects, and maths to determine which cats can be unlocked and how long it takes for the village to be fixed

•	Created a website to display my work using Jekyll, ruby, and markdown
