This game is still currently being planned. I want to use this project to develop my unity skills. Currently, there are incomplete scripts and some assets. 

Wings of Truce will be a story game where the player can make different choices and get different endings. The endings won't always be determined by choices, but also the outcome of minigames.

My goals for this project are to improve writing and scripting skills, and unity mechanics skills.
