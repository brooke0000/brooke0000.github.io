After an evil wizard cat destroyed the cat village, it is your job to help the mayor cat to rebuild it. You unlock cats and manage them by leveling up their skills and assigning them jobs.

Currently, this game has a cutscene with music and sound effects. There is also an interaction with the mayor cat asking for your help. The player can either agree or deny help.

This is another solo project so all of the designs and development are done by me. 

This is to further my skills in web development by focusing on timings for the cutscene, calculating how fast money is earned based on several factors, and to try and use more object-orientated programming to improve my coding technique.

The next steps for this is to figure out an efficient system to handle money generation. 

So far, this project has helped me to understand coordinates and timings from coding the cutscene.
