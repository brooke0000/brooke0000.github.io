This was my game for my university coursework. It's a platformer where you have to jump to the top of a volcano to retrieve an ancient artefact. 

Core gameplay mechanics have been implemented such as level selection, interactive story, and collision detection. All custom assets (backgrounds, characters, enemies, and power-ups) have been designed for future implementation. Placeholder buttons have also been added for the upcoming features. 

This was my first solo project where everything was made by me from scratch. I developed the game mechanics and drew all the visual assets for the backgrounds and character designs.

This made me learn and develop many skills - especially for key controls, clicking function, and file handling. Also strengthened my CSS, HTML, and JavaScript skills. Gained a lot of practical experience in web development - particularly for game development. Developed a better understanding of interactive storytelling techniques.

Even though this was only a university project, I want to continue developing this. My next steps are to fix any bugs and to add enemies.

The Volcano Venture project deepened my understanding of coding web-games. This project was a significant step in my journey to become a game developer or web developer, and I'm eager to expand it further.
